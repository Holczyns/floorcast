      <p>
        FloorCast draws the plan of the home with what happens in it: lights and their glow, open windows and blinds,
        temperatures and other readings, people seen by radars and cameras, the mower and the vacuum with their tracks,
        sprinklers while they water and camera stills.

        <li>
          <b>The integration</b> keeps the plan, tracks people, places the robots, fetches camera images and counts people
          in rooms and zones.

          In <b>Building</b>, draw the outer walls with <b>Wall</b>, then the inner walls. Place doors and windows on them and

        <li>In <b>Objects</b>, draw the lawn, paving, terrace and furniture you want to see.</li>

          <b>Wall types</b> (General) give the thickness of every wall of the type, for example <i>Outer wall 27.5 cm</i>,
